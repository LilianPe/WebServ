# Webserv üåê

**Webserv** is a project to develop a web server in C++, capable of handling HTTP requests. The goal is to understand how a web server works and build it from scratch. This project is part of the 42 curriculum, focusing on system programming and network management. The servers works using sockets.

## Objectives

The main goal of the project is to create a web server that can effectively handle HTTP requests. The project is including the methods GET, POST and DELETE, sending appropriate responses, and managing errors. It also involves configuring a server, serving static files, and handling multiple simultaneous connections.

## Features üß©

- **Handling HTTP requests**: The server is able to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests.
- **HTTP headers management**: The server can parse and respond with correct HTTP headers.
- **Static files**: The server can serve static files such as images, CSS, or JavaScript files.
- **Virtual Hosts**: The server can handle multiple virtual hosts with distinct configurations.
- **Error handling**: The server correctly respond to errors such as 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error).
